    "### Problem 1. Markdown\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is a very light, beautiful and convenient way to organize your research and display your results. Let's play with it for a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you can double-click each cell and edit its content. If you want to run a cell (that is, execute the code inside it), use Cell > Run Cells in the top menu or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, each cell has a type. There are two main types: Markdown (which is for any kind of free text, explanations, formulas, results... you get the idea), and code (which is, well... for code :D).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me give you a...\n",
    "#### Quick Introduction to Markdown\n",
    "##### Text and Paragraphs\n",
    "There are several things that you can do. As you already saw, you can write paragraph text just by typing it. In order to create a new paragraph, just leave a blank line. See how this works below:\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is some text.\n",
    "This text is on a new line, but it will continue the same paragraph (so you can make your paragraphs more easily readable by just continuing on a new line, or just go on and on like this one line is ever continuing).\n",
    "\n",
    "This text is displayed in a new paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is yet another paragraph.\n",
    "```\n",

    "And this is yet another paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Headings\n",
    "There are six levels of headings. Level one is the highest (largest and most important), and level 6 is the smallest. You can create headings of several types by prefixing the header line with one to six \"#\" symbols (this is called a pound sign if you are ancient, or a sharp sign if you're a musician... or a hashtag if you're too young :D). Have a look:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Heading 1\n",
    "## Heading 2\n",
    "### Heading 3\n",

    "##### Heading 5\n",
    "###### Heading 6\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you have **only one** H1 heading - this should be the header of your notebook (or scientific paper). Below that, you can add your name or just jump to the explanations directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Emphasis\n",
    "You can create emphasized (stronger) text by using a **bold** or _italic_ font. You can do this in several ways (using asterisks (\\*) or underscores (\\_)). In order to \"escape\" a symbol, prefix it with a backslash (\\). You can also strike through your text in order to signify a correction.\n",
    "```\n",
    "**bold** __bold__\n",
    "*italic* _italic_\n",

    "\n",
    "I ~~didn't make~~ a mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Lists\n",
    "You can add two types of lists: ordered and unordered. Lists can also be nested inside one another. To do this, press <kbd>Tab</kbd> once (it will be converted to 4 spaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an ordered list, just type the numbers. Don't worry if your numbers are wrong - Jupyter Notebook will create them properly for you. Well, it's better to have them properly numbered anyway...\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. This is\n",
    "2. A list\n",
    "10. With many\n",
    "9. Items\n",

    "        - list\n",
    "        \n",
    "##### Links\n",
    "There are many ways to create links but we mostly use one of them: we present links with some explanatory text. See how it works:\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is [a link](http://google.com) to Google.\n",

    "\n",

    "##### Images\n",
    "They are very similar to links. Just prefix the image with an exclamation mark. The alt(ernative) text will be displayed if the image is not available. Have a look (hover over the image to see the title text):\n",
    "```\n",

    "Did I mention these cells support HTML, CSS and JavaScript? Now I did.\n",

    "These are a pain because they need to be formatted (somewhat) properly. Here's a good [table generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables). Just select File > Paste table data... and provide a tab-separated list of values. It will generate a good-looking ASCII-art table for you.\n",

So, thanks to Donald Knuth (a very popular computer scientist, who also invented a lot of algorithms), we have a nice typesetting system, called LaTeX (pronounced _lah_-tek).

    "### Problem 4. Equation of a Line\n",
    "Let's go back to our linear equations and systems. There are many ways to define what \"linear\" means, but they all boil down to the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation $ax + b = 0$ is called *linear* because the function $f(x) = ax+b$ is a linear function. We know that there are several ways to know what one particular function means. One of them is to just write the expression for it, as we did above. Another way is to **plot** it. This is one of the most exciting parts of maths and science - when we have to fiddle around with beautiful plots (although not so beautiful in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function produces a straight line and we can see it.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we plot functions in general? Ww know that functions take many (possibly infinitely many) inputs. We can't draw all of them. We could, however, evaluate the function at some points and connect them with tiny straight lines. If the points are too many, we won't notice - the plot will look smooth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's take a function, e.g. $y = 2x + 3$ and plot it. For this, we're going to use `numpy` arrays. This is a special type of array which has two characteristics:\n",
    "* All elements in it must be of the same type\n",
    "* All operations are **broadcast**: if `x = [1, 2, 3, 10]` and we write `2 * x`, we'll get `[2, 4, 6, 20]`. That is, all operations are performed at all indices. This is very powerful, easy to use and saves us A LOT of looping.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's one more thing: it's blazingly fast because all computations are done in C, instead of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's import `numpy`. Since the name is a bit long, a common convention is to give it an **alias**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Import that at the top cell and don't forget to re-run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's create a range of values, e.g. $[-3, 5]$. There are two ways to do this. `np.arange(start, stop, step)` will give us evenly spaced numbers with a given step, while `np.linspace(start, stop, num)` will give us `num` samples. You see, one uses a fixed step, the other uses a number of points to return. When plotting functions, we usually use the latter. Let's generate, say, 1000 points (we know a straight line only needs two but we're generalizing the concept of plotting here :)).\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = np.linspace(-3, 5, 1000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, let's generate our function variable\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y = 2 * x + 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can print the values if we like but we're more interested in plotting them. To do this, first let's import a plotting library. `matplotlib` is the most commnly used one and we usually give it an alias as well.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's plot the values. To do this, we just call the `plot()` function. Notice that the top-most part of this notebook contains a \"magic string\": `%matplotlib inline`. This hints Jupyter to display all plots inside the notebook. However, it's a good practice to call `show()` after our plot is ready.\n",

    "plt.plot(x, y)\n",
    "plt.show()\n",

Since they should be equal, the point of their intersection is the solution of the given equation. We don't need to bother marking the point of intersection right now, just showing the functions.\n",

    "### Problem 8. Trigonometric Functions\n",
    "We already saw the graph of the function $y = \\sin(x)$. But, how do we define the trigonometric functions once again? Let's quickly review that.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"angle-in-right-triangle.png\" style=\"max-height: 200px\" alt=\"Right triangle\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The two basic trigonometric functions are defined as the ratio of two sides:\n",
    "$$ \\sin(x) = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} $$\n",
    "$$ \\cos(x) = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} $$\n",
    "\n",

    "$$ \\cot(x) = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{opposite}} = \\frac{\\cos(x)}{\\sin(x)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is fine, but using this, \"right-triangle\" definition, we're able to calculate the trigonometric functions of angles up to $90^\\circ$. But we can do better. Let's now imagine a circle centered at the origin of the coordinate system, with radius $r = 1$. This is called a \"unit circle\".\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"triangle-unit-circle.png\" style=\"max-height: 300px\" alt=\"Trigonometric unit circle\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now see exactly the same picture. The $x$-coordinate of the point in the circle corresponds to $\\cos(\\alpha)$ and the $y$-coordinate - to $\\sin(\\alpha)$. What did we get? We're now able to define the trigonometric functions for all degrees up to $360^\\circ$. After that, the same values repeat: these functions are **periodic**: \n",

    "$$ \\sin(90^\\circ + \\alpha) = \\cos(\\alpha) $$\n",

    "A very important property of the sine and cosine is that they accept values in the range $(-\\infty; \\infty)$ and produce values in the range $[-1; 1]$.

    "\n",
    "#### Radians\n",
    "A degree is a geometric object, $1/360$th of a full circle. This is quite inconvenient when we work with angles. There is another, natural and intrinsic measure of angles. It's called the **radian** and can be written as $\\text{rad}$ or without any designation, so $\\sin(2)$ means \"sine of two radians\".\n",
    "![Radian definition](radian.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's defined as *the central angle of an arc with length equal to the circle's radius* and $1\\text{rad} \\approx 57.296^\\circ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the circle circumference is $C = 2\\pi r$, therefore we can fit exactly $2\\pi$ arcs with length $r$ in $C$. The angle corresponding to this is $360^\\circ$ or $2\\pi\\ \\text{rad}$. Also, $\\pi rad = 180^\\circ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Some people prefer using $\\tau = 2\\pi$ to avoid confusion with always multiplying by 2 or 0.5 but we'll use the standard notation here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** All trigonometric functions in `math` and `numpy` accept radians as arguments. In order to convert between radians and degrees, you can use the relations $\\text{[deg]} = 180/\\pi.\\text{[rad]}, \\text{[rad]} =  \\pi/180.\\text{[deg]}$. This can be done using `np.deg2rad()` and `np.rad2deg()` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inverse trigonometric functions\n",
    "All trigonometric functions have their inverses. If you plug in, say $\\pi/4$ in the $\\sin(x)$ function, you get $\\sqrt{2}/2$. The inverse functions (also called, arc-functions) take arguments in the interval $[-1; 1]$ and return the angle that they correspond to. Take arcsine for example:\n",
    "$$ \\arcsin(y) = x: sin(y) = x $$\n",
    "$$ \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this is NOT entirely correct. From the relations we found:\n",
    "$$\\sin(x) = sin(2k\\pi + x), k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\n",
    "\n",
    "it follows that $\\arcsin(x)$ has infinitely many values, separated by $2k\\pi$ radians each:\n",
    "$$ \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + 2k\\pi, k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, however, we're interested in the first value (when $k = 0$). It's called the **principal value**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note 1: There are inverse functions for all four basic trigonometric functions: $\\arcsin$, $\\arccos$, $\\arctan$, $\\text{arccot}$. These are sometimes written as $\\sin^{-1}(x)$, $\\cos^{-1}(x)$, etc. These definitions are completely equivalent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just notice the difference between $\\sin^{-1}(x) := \\arcsin(x)$ and $\\sin(x^{-1}) = \\sin(1/x)$."

    "### ** Problem 9. Perlin Noise\n",
    "This algorithm has many applications in computer graphics and can serve to demonstrate several things... and help us learn about math, algorithms and Python :).\n",
    "#### Noise\n",
    "Noise is just random values. We can generate noise by just calling a random generator. Note that these are actually called *pseudorandom generators*. We'll talk about this later in this course.\n",
    "We can generate noise in however many dimensions we want. For example, if we want to generate a single dimension, we just pick N random values and call it a day. If we want to generate a 2D noise space, we can take an approach which is similar to what we already did with `np.meshgrid()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{noise}(x, y) = N, N \\in [n_{min}, n_{max}] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This function takes two coordinates and returns a single number N between $n_{min}$ and $n_{max}$. (This is what we call a \"scalar field\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Random variables are always connected to **distributions**. We'll talk about these a great deal but now let's just say that these define what our noise will look like. In the most basic case, we can have \"uniform noise\" - that is, each point in our little noise space $[n_{min}, n_{max}]$ will have an equal chance (probability) of being selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Perlin noise\n",
    "There are many more distributions but right now we'll want to have a look at a particular one. **Perlin noise** is a kind of noise which looks smooth. It looks cool, especially if it's colored. The output may be tweaked to look like clouds, fire, etc. 3D Perlin noise is most widely used to generate random terrain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm\n",
    "... Now you're on your own :). Research how the algorithm is implemented (note that this will require that you understand some other basic concepts like vectors and gradients).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your task\n",
    "1. Research about the problem. See what articles, papers, Python notebooks, demos, etc. other people have created\n",
    "2. Create a new notebook and document your findings. Include any assumptions, models, formulas, etc. that you're using\n",
    "3. Implement the algorithm. Try not to copy others' work, rather try to do it on your own using the model you've created\n",
    "4. Test and improve the algorithm\n",
    "5. (Optional) Create a cool demo :), e.g. using Perlin noise to simulate clouds. You can even do an animation (hint: you'll need gradients not only in space but also in time)\n",
    "6. Communicate the results (e.g. in the Softuni forum)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: [This](http://flafla2.github.io/2014/08/09/perlinnoise.html) is a very good resource. It can show you both how to organize your notebook (which is important) and how to implement the algorithm."
